**Insight:**  
- Total customers contacted: *[calculated from customers table]*  
- Total responses: *[calculated from responses table]*  
- Overall conversion rate: *[calculated from responses table]*  

The overall conversion rate shows what percentage of customers accepted the bank’s offer.  
This helps marketing teams understand if current campaigns are effective or need redesign.

- Track overall conversion trends daily to monitor campaign performance.

## Day 4 – Campaign ROI Analysis

Campaigns with higher conversion rates do not always generate the highest ROI.
Some campaigns produce fewer conversions but are significantly more cost-efficient,
leading to higher overall profitability.

Campaigns ranked highest by ROI should be prioritized for scaling,
while low-ROI campaigns should be reviewed or discontinued to optimize marketing spend.
